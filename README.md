# 🔐 Self-Contained Pentest Lab

> A Docker-based environment for practicing web app penetration testing — no VMs, no setup headaches.

This lab includes:
- 🍹 **OWASP Juice Shop** — modern vulnerable web app  
- 🛡️ **OWASP ZAP** — headless scanning & API access  
- 🖥️ **Portainer** *(optional)* — container management GUI  

Built for repeatability, learning, and toolchain integration.

## 💡 Why I Built This

> During my cybersecurity training, I struggled with inconsistent lab setups — broken VMs, port conflicts, missing tools.  
>  
> This lab solves that by:  
> - Isolating services in containers  
> - Pre-configuring ZAP for automation (e.g., CI/CD integration)  
> - Allowing quick reset with `docker-compose down && up`  
>  
> ✅ I use this daily for:  
> - Testing **gobuster** + **sqlmap** workflows  
> - Simulating full recon → exploit → report cycles  
> - Training on modern app vulnerabilities (JWT, SSRF, XXE)
